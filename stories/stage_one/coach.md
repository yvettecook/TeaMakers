As a coach
If I want to create a new Make-a-thon
Then I visit teaMAkers homepage

If I'm on the homepage
When I click 'Create new Make-a-Thon'
Then I go to Create Page

Click on 'add project'
Then I fill in project name and description
And click submit

On the 'Create Page'
Click on 'add students'
Then I add student users (emails) to database
And submit

When all projects and users entered
Then I click on Generate Make-a-Thon
And emails are sent out to the students
